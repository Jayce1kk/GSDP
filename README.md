### Overview

Synthesizing high-quality reasoning data for continual training has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous synthetic approaches struggle to scale up data cost-efficiently and often generate data similar to the seed. In this paper, we propose the Graph-based Synthetic Data Pipeline (GSDP), an elegant and efficient framework for scaling high-quality reasoning instructions. Inspired by the cognitive mechanism in human learning, we extract knowledge points from seed data and construct a knowledge point relationships graph to explore their interconnections. We innovatively propose to leverage both explicit and implicit relationships in the graph for new data synthesis, which achieves a 255-fold data expansion and generates more diverse data. Furthermore, GSDP, powered by open-source models, produces synthesis quality comparable to GPT-4-0613 while keeping costs 100 times lower. Focusing on the challenging domain of mathematical reasoning, we present the GSDP-MATH dataset comprising over 1.91 million math question-solution pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that GSDP-MATH features superior data quality, and models fine-tuned on it outperform other methods in mathematical and out-of-domain reasoning tasks.
